Repository for GCU CST-150 (Activity 3)

## Activity 3 - activity 1 duplicate git push
In this assignment, I used git(bash) to commit files that were used in Activity 1, to this repository.

Hello Professor Smithers, are we to use this repository to house all of the rest of the assignments? Or should this repo only be used for this assignment?
